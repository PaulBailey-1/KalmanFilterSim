# Kalman Filter Simulation

This is a C++ implementation of a Kalman Filter for preforming localization for a differential drive robot base. It includes propagation from 2 wheel encoders with odometry, and updates from a gyroscope, and from a camera running an Apriltag detector. These sensors are simulated, with error being generated by a Gaussian distribution fit from data collected on a standard FRC skid steer base. The robot follows a linear path, with simulated AprilTags placed on a virtual field. The code uses Eigen for the filter implementation and SMFL for a graphical display, showing the real robot pose, estimated pose, and covariance ellipse. Logs can be generated as CSV files.
